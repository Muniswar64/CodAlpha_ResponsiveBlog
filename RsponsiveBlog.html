                    <p> A Romanian Deadlift (RDL) is a deadlift in which the body is bent at the hips and the knees are not bent. 
                        The deadlift is a strengthening exercise where a loaded barbell is lifted off the ground from a stabilized, bent over position, knees free to bend. 
                        It is one of the three canonical powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press.
                        It can improve mobility and flexibility [of the hips] as well as unlock faulty movement patterns, which will decrease the risk of injury," Ward said. She added that the exercise can also help prevent and minimize low back pain, a common cause of discomfort that can pop up due to muscle imbalances, like a weak back, which can ultimately lead to poor core stability and hip strength.

                    <p >The one-arm dumbbell row is a good addition to any dumbbell workout. 
                        This movement targets the upper and lower back, shoulders, biceps, and hips while improving core stability.
                        Five different joint actions take place in this compound exercise.  
                        Although there is not one best type of fitness equipment, dumbbells offer a number of benefits both in strength training and cardiorespiratory fitness.
                        In fact, Ruben Borges, CPPS, PPSC, a certified strength and conditioning coach and owner of Glute World Order emphasizes that dumbbells allow you to train heavy, often, and safely.
                        While you grow your upper back and lats, your lower back and core will work hard to stabilize your torso.They’re  effective for building mass .

                    <p>The leg press is a popular piece of gym equipment that can help build key muscles in your legs. 
                        There are two leg press machines commonly found in gyms and home gyms: the standard horizontal leg press and the 45-degree leg press, with a seat that reclines at an angle while your legs press upward in a diagonal direction.
                        The diagonal (incline) or vertical 'sled' type leg press. Weight plates are attached directly to the sled, which is mounted on rails. 
                        These machines normally include adjustable safety brackets that prevent the user from being trapped under the weight. It helps in  increasing your balance and stability,

                    <h2>Pull Ups</h2>
                    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRNQ2TWWkqOfE_udE83YF9QWzKZ9355kPUd8w&usqp=CAU">
                    
                    <p> A pull-up is an upper-body strength exercise. The pull-up is a closed-chain movement where the body is suspended by the hands, gripping a bar or other implement at a distance typically wider than shoulder-width, and pulled up. As this happens, the elbows flex and the shoulders adduct and extend to bring the elbows to the torso.
                        Pull-ups build up several muscles of the upper body, including the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and biceps brachii. A pull-up may be performed with overhand (pronated), underhand (supinated)—sometimes referred to as a chin-up—neutral, or rotating hand position.
                        Pull-ups are used by some organizations as a component of fitness tests, and as a conditioning activity for some sports.
